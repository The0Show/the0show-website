# the0show-website

This is my old website. It has been replaced by [https://the0show.com](https://the0show.com). Instead of deleting this repository, I'm keeping it up. That way, developers can see that running a site like mine on a service like GitHub Pages is possible.

I used the Industrious template by TEMPLATED. They seem to have deleted their site and socials, but I found the template being rehosted [here](https://themewagon.com/themes/free-responsive-business-template/).

If you have any other questions, feel free to [reach out](https://the0show.com/contact). I'll be happy to answer and help :D
